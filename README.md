Build mobile app with dart/flutter and python 

Tasks are sorted by type (experience, Gold),
and difficulty (easy medium hard)

Add rewards for xp level ups and “side quests”

Players create their own rewards, which can be earned by redeeming Gold

Experience quests building healthy habits within your hobbies and goals.
If you're an artist, maybe a sidequest can be blocking out time to create something.
Or, perhaps for those who want to build a new habit of reading a book,
a sidequest could be a goal to read a chapter of a book.

Gold can also be awaarded from quests, which can be used to unlock rewards.
Players define their own rewards and gold costs-- for example, maybe earning 10 gold
allows you to buy yourself a snack, or 1000 gold leads to a concert ticket!

Experience quests fill individual skill bars, which leads to Level Ups.
Skills are defined by the player (but can have added skills for your personal
goals). When a player levels up a skill, they get additional gold to spend on 
rewards. Skills eventually get harder to level up, but show the progress you've 
made.
